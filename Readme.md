# 1. Project 1 : Memory Card Game
“Memory card” is a memory game that requires the player to match images. The player can adjust the settings of the game such as the theme of the image cards to be matched.
<br> If the player correctly matches two identical cards, they will remain open. Else, the cards will flip back hiding their images for user to guess again. 
<br>The rule of the game is very simple, you have to Match all the pairs of identical cards in the shortest possible time (for Solo mode) or to find as many pairs as possible (for 2 player mode). 
Each turn, you can only turn over 2 cards.
