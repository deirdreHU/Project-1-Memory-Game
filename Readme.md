# 1. Project 1 : Memory Card Game
“Memory card” is a memory game that requires the player to match images. The player can adjust the settings of the game such as the theme of the image cards to be matched.
<br> If the player correctly matches two identical cards, they will remain open. Else, the cards will flip back hiding their images for user to guess again. 
<br>The rule of the game is very simple, you have to Match all the pairs of identical cards in the shortest possible time (for Solo mode) or to find as many pairs as possible (for 2 player mode). 
Each turn, you can only turn over 2 cards.

# 2. Build With

<br>

# 3.Concepts and Features Used
- Fetch Unsplash API to randomize the images used for the card
- Add a timer to record the duration of the game time
- CSS to make the UI properly
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation

<br>

# 4. Challengs
- Designing the CSS to ensure that the game is functioning as desired and required
- Linking the settings selected to the gameplay such that they are reflected accordingly
- Determining the start and end of each player's turn during the game and calculating their scores such that it reflects accurately ingame
- Generating the images for the cards and ensuring that they are categorized accordingly to their respective themes as set in Settings

# 5. Things I Would Like to Improve On
- Add a scoreboard system where each game session is recorded in a log to keep track of the player's achievements and progress
- Try to utilize the localStorage of the scores
- Add a loading page when the game is loading i.e. change of Settings, entering the game, game beginning
- Organize the code such that it is neater and more legible at a glance
